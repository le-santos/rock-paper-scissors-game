# rock-paper-scissor-game
This is a basic Rock-paper-scissor game made with HTML/CSS/JavaScript. It's a project from [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).

## How to play:
You can play this game by opening index.html in your web browser. All the commands are made through mouse interactions (click).

The New game button starts a new game (or reset/restart a game).Choose your option and check the Round Result. The game ends when the user or the computer gets the max points.

## What did I learn?
That is one of my very first projects using JavaScript. 
The purpose of this project was to apply the basic knowledge of interaction with html elements and to practice the programming logic.
